touch
=====

* Update the access date and/or modification date of file or directory

What it does
============

```touch``` updates a file or directory's modification date. If the file does not exist, ```touch``` effectively creates a new, empty file to work with. This latter example is the use case many in the journalism world use frequently.

> ["Touch eliminates the unnecessary steps of opening the file, saving the file, and closing the file again. Instead it simply updates the dates associated with the file or directory."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_%28Unix%29)

Examples
