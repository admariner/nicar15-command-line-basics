grep
=====

Grep is like a "find everything" function on sterioids. It allows for global (everything) searches for a given regular expression, which is essentially just a series of characters, spaces, or any other pattern. Grep can be modified in any number of ways to allow for things like searching partial matches, captialization, and many other things (see some examples [here](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/03/15-practical-unix-grep-command-examples/)).

* [grep](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex18.html): **g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint
