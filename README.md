How I learned to take command of the command line: A journalists guide to getting started
=========================================================================================

* This hands-on session aims to help command line novices learn some basic commands that can help them every day, including navigating through directories, creating files and tools to look at and work with structured data. If you're familiar with grep and curl this will likely be review. We'll end by highlighting some command line libraries that are musts for reporters. and provide additional resources so participants can go deeper on their own.

* If we're going to be using Mac OS or Linux (I think you mentioned this was a possibility?), we'll be ok with the standard terminal application.
* If it's a Windows machine, I'd recommend installing Cygwin and making sure that curl is installed.

Why not get started early? Based on a [discussion post-#NICAR14](https://twitter.com/mikejcorey/status/440159788979077121), this repo will keep track of some ideas to show command line newcomers some easy to use tools and time-saving tricks.

Maybe it's "Five command line tools and tricks to change your life" Or put a better way by [@jacqui](https://twitter.com/jacqui): "If we can (try to) demystify d3 we can (try to) demystify shell."
